      Every aspect of this assignment was very new to me. The most difficult
      part was probably just the setup. I am not very familiar with what may be
      considered basic coding terminology and practices so the content is a
      bit hard to follow. I attempted to follow the Git-it tutorial but got
      stuck after downloading all the neccessary programs. I ended up just
      going to a TA's office hours and they walked me through how to create a
      html file, open it with Atom, and commit the file using Git Desktop. I
      still feel as if I don't completely understand what I am doing, but I
      know how to do something now so that is a win.
